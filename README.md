My first attempt at this modern tool

Dylan Critchfield.
I'm a hardworking, eternally curious student athlete, 
from Colorado, searching for computer science related job
experience. I attend Willamette University in Salem, Oregon
where I'm pursuing a degree in computer science, minoring in 
mathematics as well as arts, technology, and multimedia while 
also playing varsity basketball. Take a look at my latest Résumé.
